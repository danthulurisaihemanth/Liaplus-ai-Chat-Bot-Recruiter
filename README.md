Liaplus AI Chatbot – Prompt Engineer Shortlisting Assistant
This is a smart chatbot built to simplify and speed up the hiring process for Prompt Engineers. The project uses Flask and Machine Learning to evaluate candidate responses in real-time, giving instant shortlisting decisions based on how well they align with role expectations.

🔍 What It Does
Conversational AI: Interacts with candidates naturally via chat.

Automated Evaluation: Uses text processing and similarity scores to assess candidates.

Instant Feedback: Generates a score with explanations as soon as the candidate replies.

Easy Integration: REST APIs allow this system to plug into existing HR tools.

Clean UI: Simple and responsive frontend for chatting and reviewing results.

Database Support: Keeps records of all conversations and evaluations.

Built to Scale: Designed with a modular Flask architecture, ready for deployment.

🧪 ML Behind the Scenes
The candidate is scored using:

TF-IDF vectorization to extract text features.

Cosine similarity to match input against a job description profile.

Scoring Weights:

70% Skill match (AI, prompt design, Python, GPT)

30% Experience relevance (LLMs, NLP projects)

Candidates with a final score above 60% are shortlisted.
